Simply speaking “this” is the **reference to the object that is executing the current function**.
But what the current object is, changes depending on where this is being used.

The value of this will depend on where the function is called on run-time which you’ll call the **“call-site”** in technical terms.


There are 4 simple rules that describe how “this” works

1. Default binding
2. Implicit binding
3. Explicit binding
4. “new” operator
