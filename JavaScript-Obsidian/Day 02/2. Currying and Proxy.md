# Currying

Currying is a transformation of functions that translates a function from callable as `f(a, b, c)` into callable as `f(a)(b)(c)`

It divided the arguments and function calls to be called separately.  Instead of taking all the arguments at once, we can divide when their usage.

## Why should I use currying?

There are several reasons why currying is ideal:

- Currying is a checking method to make sure that you get everything you need before you proceed
- It helps you to avoid passing the same variable again and again
- It divides your function into multiple smaller functions that can handle one responsibility. This makes your function pure and less prone to errors and side effects
- It is used in functional programming to create a higher-order function





```js
//Noncurried version
const add = (a, b, c)=>{
    return a + b + c
}
console.log(add(2, 3, 5)) // 10

//Curried version
const addCurry =(a) => {
    return (b)=>{
        return (c)=>{
            return a+b+c
        }
    }
}
console.log(addCurry(2)(3)(5)) // 10
```

we nested 3 functions, dividing each argument thats needed.
So we receive as argument, a, which calls b which calls c.
At this point we have all the arguments, so we can now do the calculation and return.


Like so,
```js
const getPanCakeIngredients = (ingredient1) =>{
    return (ingredient2) => {
        return (ingredient3) => {
            return ${ingredient1}, ${ingredient2}, ${ingredient3}; 
        } 
    } 
} 
getPanCakeIngredients('Egg')('flour')('milk');
```


Currying can be performed partially,

```js
function sum(a) {
    return (b) => {
        return (c) => {
            return a + b + c
        }
    }
}
console.log(sum(1)(2)(3)) // 6
```

can be performed like so,

```js
const sum1 = sum(1);
const sum2 = sum1(2);
const result = sum2(3);
console.log(result); // 6
```

sum1 returns,

```js
return (b) => {
        return (c) => {
            return a + b + c
        }
}
```

sum2 returns 

```js 
return (c) => {
	return a + b + c
}
```

Now in result, we provide it with the 3rd argument, in sum2
a+b+c is calculated and returned now that it has all its arguments.
