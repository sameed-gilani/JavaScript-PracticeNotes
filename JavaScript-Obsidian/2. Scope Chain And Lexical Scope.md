- Lexical environment is the local memory along with the lexical environment of its parent.


**Scope** refers to the _area_ where an item (such as a function or variable) is visible and accessible to other [code](https://www.codesweetly.com/document-vs-data-vs-code/).

**Note:**

- **Global scope** means global space or a public space.
- **Block scope** means a local region or a restricted region by braces in JS
- **Functions scope** belongs to the inside of a functions


## Scope Chain

- Scope chain is the chain of scope that are traversed in order to get to the execution context (I believe) in which the variable is available.

```js
// Define a variable in the global scope:  
const fullName = "Oluwatobi Sofela";  
  
// Define nested functions:  
function profile() {  
    function sayName() {  
        function writeName() {  
            return fullName;  
        }  
        return writeName();  
    }  
    return sayName();  
}  
  
console.log(profile());
```

writeName() is scoped within sayName(). So write name checks for the existence of `fullName` within its on scope and its parents.

Similarly, sayName() goes through its own scope of its parent Profile() scope.

Profile() goes through its own scope and then its parents, which is the global scope.
Here the variable `fullName` is present and is accessed by writeName()

**writeName() scope ---> sayName() scope ---> profile() scope ---> global scope**

This access and linking of scopes is the scope chain.


In other words, there are four (4) spaces from `fullName`â€™s invocation scope to its lexical scope (the _global scope_ in this instance).



```js
// First fullName variable defined in the global scope:
const fullName = "Oluwatobi Sofela";

// Nested functions containing two more fullName variables:
function profile() {
  const fullName = "Tobi Sho";
  function sayName() {
    const fullName = "Oluwa Sofe";
    function writeName() {
      return fullName;
    }
    return writeName();
  }
  return sayName();
}
```

the output will be,
Oluwa Sofe.

Because writeName() discovered `fullName` in its immediate parents scope, which for it is the latest version of `fullName`


## Lexical Scope in JavaScript?

**Lexical scope** is the _definition_ area of an expression.

In other words, an item's lexical scope is the place in which the item got _created_.

**Note:**

- Another name for lexical scope is _static scope_.
- The place an item got invoked (or called) is not necessarily the item's lexical scope. Instead, an item's _definition space_ is its lexical scope.


```js
// Define a variable in the global scope:
const myName = "Oluwatobi";

// Call myName variable from a function:
function getName() {
  return myName;
}
```

myName is defined in the global scope, therefore its lexical scope is the global scope


```js
// Define a function:
function showLastName() {
  const lastName = "Sofela";
  return lastName;
}

// Define another function:
function displayFullName() {
  const fullName = "Oluwatobi " + lastName;
  return fullName;
}

// Invoke displayFullName():
console.log(displayFullName());

// The invocation above will return:
Uncaught ReferenceError: lastName is not defined
```

This returns an error because `displayFullName` does not have access to `lastName`.
`lastName` has a different lexical scope then `displayFullName`.

its scope is its self and global.
while `lastName` has its self and global.

So, it is not accessible.



```js
/ Define a function:  
function showLastName() {  
    const lastName = "Sofela";  
    return lastName;  
}  
  
let lastName = "New Scoped"  
  
// Define another function:  
function displayFullName() {  
    const fullName = "Oluwatobi " + lastName;  
    return fullName;  
}  
  
// Invoke displayFullName():  
console.log(displayFullName());
```

Returns, Oluwatobi New Scoped.
because the `let lastName` has its scope in global.

So now, `displayFullName` can access it.


```js
function showLastName() {
  const lastName = "Sofela";
  return lastName;
}

// Define another function:
function displayFullName() {
  const fullName = "Oluwatobi " + showLastName();
  return fullName;
}

// Invoke displayFullName():
console.log(displayFullName());

// The invocation above will return:
"Oluwatobi Sofela"
```

This also works now. Because now, `displayFullName` and `showLastName` have the same lexical scope.
