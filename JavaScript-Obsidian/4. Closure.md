- A function bundled together (enclosed) with its lexical environment is a closure.

- So even if a closure is called later, after its parent function has been removed from call stack, the closure will retain its lexical scope (the variables from its immediate parent etc)

- So with closures, even if the outer function ceases to exist, 
  the enclosed function i.e the closure will retain its lexical scope.


The closure has three scope chains:

- it has access to its own scope — variables defined between its curly brackets
- it has access to the outer function’s variables
- it has access to the global variables

```js
function numberGenerator() {  
    // Local “free” variable that ends up within the closure  
    var num = 1;  
    function checkNumber() {  
        console.log(num);  
    }  
    num++;  
    return checkNumber;  
}  
  
var number = numberGenerator();  
number(); // 2
```

when we call number()

`numberGenerator()` runs. which immediately returns `checkNumber()` 
`checkNumber()` tries printing `num`
it retains its lexical scope, which is itself and `numberGenerator` so it has access to the latest value of `num`
which after `num++` is 2
therefore it prints 2


```js
function sayHello() {
  var say = function() { 
  console.log(hello);
   }
  // Local variable that ends up within the closure 
  var hello = 'Hello, world!';
  return say;
}
var sayHelloClosure = sayHello(); 
sayHelloClosure(); // ‘Hello, world!’
```
