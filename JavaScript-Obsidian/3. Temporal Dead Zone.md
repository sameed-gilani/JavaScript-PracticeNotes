A **temporal dead zone (TDZ)** is the area of a block where a variable is inaccessible until the moment the computer completely initializes it with a value.

Suppose you attempt to access a variable before its complete initialization. In such a case, JavaScript will throw a `ReferenceError`.

To avoid a TDZ, you should declare and initialize your variables at the top of the scope they are used in. 


```js
{
  // bestFood’s TDZ starts here (at the beginning of this block’s local scope)
  // bestFood’s TDZ continues here
  // bestFood’s TDZ continues here
  // bestFood’s TDZ continues here
  console.log(bestFood); // returns ReferenceError because bestFood’s TDZ continues here
  // bestFood’s TDZ continues here
  // bestFood’s TDZ continues here
  let bestFood = "Vegetable Fried Rice"; // bestFood’s TDZ ends here
  // bestFood’s TDZ does not exist here
  // bestFood’s TDZ does not exist here
  // bestFood’s TDZ does not exist here
}
```

```js
{
  // TDZ starts here (at the beginning of this block’s local scope)
  // bestFood’s TDZ continues here
  // bestFood’s TDZ continues here
  // bestFood’s TDZ continues here
  // bestFood’s TDZ continues here
  // bestFood’s TDZ continues here
  // bestFood’s TDZ continues here
  let bestFood; // bestFood’s TDZ ends here
  console.log(bestFood); // returns undefined because bestFood’s TDZ does not exist here
  bestFood = "Vegetable Fried Rice"; // bestFood’s TDZ does not exist here
  console.log(bestFood); // returns "Vegetable Fried Rice" because bestFood’s TDZ does not exist here
}
```


TDZ only exist for `let` and `const`.
Due to hoisting,
the declaration of the `let` and `const` variables is moved to the top. That is where their TDZ begins, up until they are initialized with a value.

Between that time, we cant access that variable. A reference error is returned.

However, for `var` TDZ does not exist, because the declaration and initializatio (to `undefined`) is hoisted to the top. 
Therefore a TDZ does not exist as they are both simultaneous.
