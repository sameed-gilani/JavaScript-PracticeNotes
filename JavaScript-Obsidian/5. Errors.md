## Reference Error

Reference errors occur when you are trying to refer to or use something that does not exist.

```javascript
let a = 1
console.log(b) // undefined variable used

//output
Uncaught ReferenceError: b is not defined
```

```js
console.log(b);  
let b =2;
```

```javascript
if(true){
    let a = 1
}

console.log(a)

//output
ReferenceError: a is not defined
```

```javascript
if(true){
	console.log(a)
    let a = 1
}


//output
ReferenceError: Cannot access 'a' before initialization
```

Type errors occur when you use something that is not intended to be used in that particular way.

```javascript
let a = 1
console.log(a()) 

//output
Uncaught TypeError: a is not a function
```


```javascript
const a = 1
a = 2 // you reassign a const type variable again

//output
TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
```

```javascript
const myArray = [1,2,3,4]
myArray = myArray.push(5) // reassign array

//output
TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
```
